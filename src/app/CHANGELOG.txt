This week, I've gotten my project started with routing, and I've gotten things set up for easy implimentation in the near fututre.
    - Angular Routing was imported into my project
    - app-routinng.ts was created
    - main-story.html and man-story.component.html were created.
    - A test code was implimented that successfully created a "Hello World" header through routing.

Over the weekend, I was able to double down and add many more routing components to my project.
    - The 'main-story' component is linked to the main card on the homepage (via the 'read more' button)
    - the login page is now active and can be reached through the corresponding  button
    - All base-level genre filters in the dropdown search bar are now linked to corresponding components.

While this is only seems like 3 different routings,, the genre routing is actually comprised of 9 different routing components, meaning that,
in total, this site now contains 11 different routing coponents.  The following components are accessible under the genre dropdown.
    - Alternative
    - Ambient
    - Electronic
    - Experimental
    - Hip-hop/Rap
    - Metal
    - Pop
    - Punk
    - Rock

Thank you so much for this extended grace period.  I genuinely appreciate it!
